# Ghost Clipper
 Clip Mouse Cursor to Windowed GHOSTBUSTERS
 
 To set GHOSTBUSTERS to run in windowed mode, follow these steps:

1. Create the folder `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GHOSTBUSTERS\`.
2. Run and exit GHOSTBUSTERS so the `settings.ini` file gets created.
3. In the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GHOSTBUSTERS\settings.ini` file, change `runWindowed=0` to `runWindowed=1`.
4. Run GHOSTBUSTERS again and set an appropriate resolution.

 You can run Ghost Clipper before or after you have started GHOSTBUSTERS.
 
 To exit Ghost Clipper, right-click the GohstBuster icon in the system tray.
 
 To move the GOSTBUSTERS window with Ghost Clipper running, press the Windows key, then drag the GHOSTBUSTERS caption.
 
 (note: the mousecursor will be invisible when hovering GHOSTBUSTERS until you press the left mousebutton on the caption)
