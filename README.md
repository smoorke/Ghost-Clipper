 Clip Mouse Cursor to Windowed GHOSTBUSTERS
 
 To set GHOSTBUSTERS to run in windowed mode, follow these steps:

1. Create the folder `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GHOSTBUSTERS\`
2. Run and exit GHOSTBUSTERS so the `settings.ini` file gets created
3. In the `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GHOSTBUSTERS\settings.ini` file, change `runWindowed=0` to `runWindowed=1`
4. Run GHOSTBUSTERS again and set an appropriate resolution

 (note: the configuration file for the regular version of GHOSTBUSTERS is located at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\GHOSTBUSTERS (tm)\`

 You can run GhostClipper before or after you have started GHOSTBUSTERS.
 
 To exit GhostClipper, right-click the GhostBuster icon in the system tray and select Quit. 
 You will also find an option to save the startup location there.
 
 To move the GOSTBUSTERS window with GhostClipper running, press the Windows key, then drag the GHOSTBUSTERS caption.
 
 (note: the mousecursor will be invisible when hovering GHOSTBUSTERS until you press the left mousebutton on the caption)
